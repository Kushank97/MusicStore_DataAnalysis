Welcome to the Music Store Data Analysis project.
This project demonstrates how to extract business insights from a music store database using intermediate SQL queries and visualize the results using Python.



Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a relational PostgreSQL database simulating a real-world music store, containing information about customers, invoices, tracks, genres, artists, employees, and more.

The project includes:

  - Writing and executing intermediate SQL queries to solve real business problems
  - Using Python (Jupyter Notebook) to connect to the PostgreSQL database
  - Visualizing key insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn



 Objectives

Understand sales trends and customer behavior
Analyze the most popular genres and artists
Identify high-value customers and purchasing patterns
Present data-driven insights through visualizations



Tools & Technologies

  PostgreSQL – SQL querying and data handling
  Python (Jupyter Notebook) – Data analysis and scripting
  Libraries: psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development and visualization


Sample Insights

Rock is the most popular genre by sales volume
Customers from the USA lead in total purchase value
op 5 customers contribute over 25% of total revenue

What I Learned

Writing optimized SQL queries across multiple tables
Connecting and querying a PostgreSQL database using Python
Creating clean, meaningful visualizations for business reporting
Interpreting and communicating analytical findings effectively
